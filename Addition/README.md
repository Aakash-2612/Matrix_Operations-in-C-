# Addition of 3X3 Matrices

Addition of two matrices can be perfomed by adding element in ith row and jth column of a matrix with another elemnt of a matrix at ith row and jth column.
That is,

**Matrix 1**
```
a b c
d e f
g h i
```

**Matrix 2**
```
j k l
m n o
p q r
```

On adding Matrix 1 and Matrix 2 we will get

**Sum**
```
(a+j) (b+k) (c+l)
(d+m) (e+n) (f+o)
(g+p) (h+q) (i+r)
```
