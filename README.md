# Matrix_Operations-in-C-
Code written in C language which can perform operations on Matrices like Addition, Multiplication, Transpose, Square and Cube of it.

# Matrices
Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. The evolution of the concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving the system of linear equations.

Matrix is an ordered rectangular arrangement of numbers (real or complex) or functions which may be represented as

[ [a1,a2,a3.......an],
 [b1,b2,b3.......bn],
 ...................,
 ...................,
 [n1,n2,n3........nn]
]

# Square Matrices
A matrix in which the number of rows is equal to the number of columns is called as a Square Matrix.
For example:-

[ [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
is a 3X3 matrix.


# Operations
Their are various operations which can be performed on a Matrix such as:-

1. Addition
2. Multiplication
3. Transpose
4. Square
5. Cube
etc.

```
This program written by me is capable of doing all the above mentioned operations on matrix.
